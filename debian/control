Description: fast, portable computation on images and tensors
 Halide is a programming language designed to make it easier to write
 high-performance image and array processing code on modern machines.
 Halide currently targets:
  * CPU architectures: X86, ARM, MIPS, Hexagon, PowerPC, RISC-V
  * Operating systems: Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Qualcomm QuRT
  * GPU Compute APIs: CUDA, OpenCL, OpenGL Compute Shaders, Apple Metal,
                     Microsoft Direct X 12
 Rather than being a standalone programming language,
 Halide is embedded in C++. This means you write C++ code that builds
 an in-memory representation of a Halide pipeline using Halide's C++ API.
 You can then compile this representation to an object file,
 or JIT-compile it and run it in the same process.

Description: fast, portable computation on images and tensors (virtual library)
 Halide is a programming language designed to make it easier to write
 high-performance image and array processing code on modern machines.
 .
 Software that uses halide can either rely on just-in-time compilation,
 in which case it runtime-depends on/links to libhalide, or it can be compiled
 ahead of time, when building the software, in which case it does not strictly
 depend on halide. Former software should depend on this package instead, to
 make it obvious which software needs to be rebuilt with newer halide versions.
 .
 This is an empty package.
